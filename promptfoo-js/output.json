You are using 2 dimensions of Bloom's taxonomy, first is the Cognitive dimension and second is the knowledge-based dimension in which the following tags are given and you have to choose skill tags from the delimited by triple quotes below.\n\nSkill tags: “””Recognizing, Recalling, Implementing, Inferring, Interpreting, Classifying, Inferring, Implementing, Comparing, Organizing, Differentiating, Analyzing, Attributing, Checking, Knowledge of terminology, Knowledge of specific details and elements, Knowledge of classifications and categories, Knowledge of subject specific skills and algorithms, Knowledge of subject specific techniques and methods, Knowledge of principles and generalizations”””\n\nAnswer should be single line JSON for e.g. {\"skillTags\": [\"tag1\", \"tag2\",\"tag3\", …]}. skill tags may be 1 or more than one. \nSkill tag should be attached on the basis of direction given below :\n\nRecognizing: In questions which are in the format of present or future questions and also suggested with all general awareness. For example “At what temperature, both Celsius and Fahrenheit scales will show the identical readings?”, “What is the SI Unit of Acceleration?”.\n\nRecalling: In questions which are in the format of past questions. For example “The eighth-century tripartite power struggle was among which of the following?”\n\nInterpreting: Solve/answer the question by understanding the meaning on what question is focusing or highlighting or when words these words found in the question “””classify, covert, conclude, demonstrate, describe, discuss, explain, identify, illustrate, locate, paraphrase, predict, recognize, report, select, summarize, translate, most appropriate, meaning, substitute, synonyms, antonyms, idioms, phrases”””. interpreting tag means the act of explaining, reframing, or otherwise showing your own understanding of something. example - In a certain code language, 'mee muk pic' is 'roses are yellow', 'nil dic' is 'white flowers', and 'pic muk dic' is 'flowers are fruits'. What is the code for 'white' in that code language?\nNow, analyze the whole explanation and example and Suggest an Interpreting tag to questions.\n\nExemplifying: Questions that ask to give examples of anything\n\nClassifying: Questions which ask to classify or categorize the given things/topics.\n\nSummarizing: If the question is asking to summarize anything or wants any information in a brief manner. \n\nInferring: When you have to draw a logical conclusion from the given information or context or when no direction is given to how to solve the given question or problem.\n\nComparing: when question is asked to compare or same way as another number,letter or group \n\nImplementing: If a learned knowledge is implemented to answer any unfamiliar situation/problem to solve the question. Implementing tags must always be suggested with Knowledge of subject-specific techniques and methods. Whenever a question require to use of some formula you must suggest Implementing it with the Knowledge of subject-specific techniques and methods\n\n\nOrganizing: When the question asks to organize the information about any topic or the given material/information in a way that it fits or functions within a structure or when a question is asked to arrange or rearrange the given data.\n\nChecking: when question is asked to find the incorrect or wrongly spelt or not is given in the main heading or direction.\n\nKnowledge of terminology: this knowledge tag is suggested when a specific term is given or question is asking a specific term related to their field} {Knowledge of specific details and elements, this knowledge tag is suggested when the question is asking for some details or with every general awareness question \n\nKnowledge of classifications and categories: when question is asked to classify the data on the basis of their category.\n\nKnowledge of principles and generalizations: when any principle or formula is asked in question \n\nKnowledge of subject specific skills and algorithms: This tag used when according to question there is a requirement to use the specific skills like if the question asked to select the correct alternative to indicate the arrangement of the following words in a logical and meaningful order. Here, in this question, one should have the skills of arranging in order. If according to question one should have to do comparison or analysis then it will be recognized as skill. Analyse yourself the above explanation and suggest the tag at required place.\n\nKnowledge of subject specific techniques and methods: this skill tag should be attached with implementing skill tag or when their is a formula required to applied in queston. \n\nQuestion: Chord AB of a circle when extended meets the tangent to the circle at point P.
